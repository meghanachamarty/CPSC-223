# Collaboration
I discussed my solution with: ULAs at office hours 

# Discussion
Since I have limited experience practicing C, I had some issues with syntax and how to code out what I had schemed out. Mainly, for loops, array, and equality (= vs ==) was confusing. Once I was able to work through these issues, I was able to write the program faster. I also had some issues with formatting. This was just a matter of going through the code slowly. Additionally, some of the edge cases were tricky, so getting those correct to make sure the correct numbers were being output took a while.
