 * - data is the value
 * - height is the height of the node within the tree, increasing
 *      from leaf up to the root.
 * - count is the number of times the data has been inserted
 *      into the tree (minus removals)
 *
 * We're defining this outside the class, which is really not good!
 * However, we're giving you a pretty printer for trees that we got
 * from somewhere else, and it will need the node structure.

 * Your client code must NOT access nodes.

 * We will take deductions for abstraction violations when we assess
 * your submission.
