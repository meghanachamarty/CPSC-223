# Collaboration
I discussed my solution with: ULAs at office hours 

# Discussion
I had some issues with understanding how to implement vectors in code. Conseptually, I understood their purpose, but I did not not know syntax and how to implement them. I also had some issues figuring out how to reference for expand and insert. I found it a lot easier to conceptualize the vectors once I figured out how they were structured. I felt better prepared due to experience with C++ and the pset having relevant content from class. Once I sorted those issues out the program ran well. Testing my script with the referance script exposed some edge cases in the program that I had not considered. Once I integrated those ideas into the code, it was able to match the reference program. After that, the only edge case I considered was the nullptr case (query not found). My code was able to handle that.
