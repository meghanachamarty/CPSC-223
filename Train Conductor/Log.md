# Collaboration
I discussed my solution with: ULAs at office hours 

# Discussion
I had some issues with understanding objects in C and how methods can access the object in the context of code. Once I was able to understand that the code was simple. I also had some issues figuring out the testing script. I found it a lot easier to conceptualize the memory structure. I felt better prepared due to experience with C and the pset having relevant content from class. I also had issues with character formatting and dealing with newline characters. This was primarily due to the differences in C and C++ for printing. Once I sorted those issues out the program ran well on the public tests and my own test cases. There were a few edge cases I ran (particularily an empty linkedlist/file) and the code was able to handle that.
